### What drew you into design systems?

Over the decades, my primary expertise has slowly migrated from back-end development to front-end. I've always had an interest in design, and working on design systems allows me to explore that interest while continuing to leverage my expertise in front-end engineering.

### Who have you learned from or been inspired by?

The constant shifts in front-end programming over the years and an intrinsic desire to learn have always been a driving factor in my own exploration of computer programming. I'm fortuante to work with a huge number of talented engineers and designers at GitHub, which is very inspiring and very rewarding.

### Favorite tools

Chrome (armed with LastPass) for almost everything, with VS Code and OneNote for random notes. Gmail/OWA with Gmail-keybindings are critical for processing mail quickly. For development, I use Kubeflow with Docker (for local development), Kubernetes (for cloud) and VS Code with exensions. Round it out with GitHub Actions and Azure Machine Learning when it's time to roll out to bigger scale.
